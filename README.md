### Data Source 

Store Sales data : The primary dataset used for this analysis is "store sales analysis"  file which contains detailed information about each sales made by the Store.

### Tools

- Excel ( This was used to Prepare, transform and visualize data ).

### Data cleaning/ Preparation 

For the data preparation phase , the following tasks were performed :

 1. Data Loading and inspection.
 2. Handling missing values. 
 3. Data cleaning and formatting. 

### Exploratory data analysis 

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key question such as  :

- Which Sales representative made the highest sales.?
- Which company purchased more chair.?
- Region with the highest sales.?

###  Results/Findings
 
The result of the analysis are summarised as follows :

- Sales were high for the second quarter of the year with the month of April being the highest.
- Marc williams made the highest sales. 
- Black color and urban model were the most purchased.

### Recommendations 

Based on the analysis , we recommend the following actions :
- Improving sales on regions generating lower sales.
- Providing colors and models that are not available.
- Find out why some companies purchase is low and try to improve sales (probably the color and model needed is'nt available).

### Limitations
I had to remove a row from the date column because it contained sale for the the year 1900 and the presence would have affected the accuracy of the analysis.
